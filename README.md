# Drops Animation

## Overview

The Drops Animation project creates a visually appealing effect where colorful drops randomly appear and disappear on the screen. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a dynamic user experience.

## Features

- **Random Drop Generation**: Drops appear at random positions within the viewport.
- **Animation**: Each drop has an animation that changes its size, color, and opacity over time.
- **Automatic Removal**: Drops disappear automatically after a specified duration.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drops-animation.git
Replace yourusername with your GitHub username.

Navigate to the project directory:

bash
cd drops-animation
Open the index.html file in your web browser:

bash
open index.html
drops-animation/
├── index.html      # Main HTML file
├── style.css       # Styles for the animation
└── script.js       # JavaScript code to create and control drops
How It Works
The index.html file contains the structure of the webpage, linking to the CSS and JavaScript files.
The style.css file styles the body and drop elements, including animation effects using CSS keyframes.
The script.js file handles the logic for creating drops at random positions and animating them.
Customization
You can customize the following aspects of the project:

Drop Color: Change the background-color property in the .drop class in style.css.
Animation Duration: Adjust the duration of the animation in the @keyframes section of style.css.
Drop Size: Modify the height and width properties in the .drop class in style.css.
Interval Timing: Change the interval for creating drops in the setInterval function in script.js.
